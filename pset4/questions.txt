0.  32 bits, 8 bits, 24 bits, 24 bits 
1.  GIF
2.  lossless : no data of the originale file is deleted ; lossy : some of the data of the original file is deleted, so can never turn back to its original quality.
3.  jpeg files use lossy compression.
4.  the address of the data, which indicates how to access to the file, is placed in the empty space list;  but the data is not
5.  two solutions : overwrite the empty space with random bits or more efficient, destroy the hard disk
6.  Stdint.h is a library of already defined structures
7.  it is usufeull when requiring entire data fixed widths, specific and accurate alignments locations
8.  8, 32, 32, 16
9.  0x42 0x4D
10. bfsize is in the BITMAPFILEHEADER struct ; bisize is in the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct
11. biHeight is negative when the image is stored from top to bottom.
12. biBitCount
13. outputfile == NULL ; couldn't create output file
14. because we want to copy only once all the bits of structures, which value is already indicated by th sizeof() function; we get though the exact copy of the first .bmp file 
15. 1
16. fseek changes the infile bytes postion, skipping the padding inputs (which are the added, with the fputc() function.
17. SEEK_CUR is a win macro which indicates the place where the fseek function looks at.
18. Rick Astley, we have a wonderfull youtube video, thanks to the bit.ly/18gECvy link in the card.raw link :)
